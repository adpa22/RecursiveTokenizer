We tested this program multiple ways.

1) One file that contained an essay, and the output was successful; all words were in order, and so were occurences

2) A folder with files that had different names, but all contained the same word with the same occurance. The sort by the file name was correct.

3) A folder that had other folders and files. The program correctly traversed through the directory and had everything in order



Error checking:

4) Passed something that was not in the directory as the second argument, we printed error and exited

5) Passed just a path ("example/") as the first argument, printed error and exited. Note "example/ex" would work since you specify a output name (ex)

6) Passed an invalid path as the first argument. We checked if the path actually existed or not, and if it didn't, we printed error and exited. 

7) Passed a name as the first argument. If that name already exists, we ask them if they want to overwrite it or not, and then proceed to do as user asks
